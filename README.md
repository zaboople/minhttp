# Minimal HTTP Server

This is a hack of https://github.com/zaboople/minhttp that I use locally for whatever sort of "mocking" I might need to do in a pinch. Right now it's just handling Myome stuff.

Running it is as simple as having java 8+ available, doing a maven build and:

    java -jar target/minhttp-1.0.0.jar --port <###>

Substitute in whatever port you want.
